\section*{Zainab Amin}
<think>
Alright, I need to help the user generate a LaTeX resume based on their provided job description and resume data. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The job is for a backend engineer with specific technical skills: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication. They also need experience with REST APIs. 

Looking at the resume data, Zainab Amin has a BTech degree, which shows they have a solid educational background in technology. Their skills include React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and Python. The experience section lists a Backend Intern role at Nexus Void where they built APIs with JWT auth. Their projects are on ReflectAI, focusing on sentiment analysis.

I should structure the LaTeX resume using appropriate sections like \section{Background}, \subsection{Technical Skills}, etc., to organize the information clearly. I need to make sure each bullet point in the skills is properly formatted within \itemize for readability.

Also, since they mentioned projects and experience, I'll include a \textit{Projects} section to highlight their work. I should avoid using any other packages or commands beyond what's standard in LaTeX to keep it simple.

I need to ensure that the language flows naturally in the text while maintaining the technical accuracy required for a resume. The bullet points under skills and projects should be concise but comprehensive, reflecting Zainab's experience and achievements.

Finally, I'll add a \subsubsection{References} section with the standard references and contact info, formatted appropriately.
