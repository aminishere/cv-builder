# ============================================
# BEGINNER-FRIENDLY .dockerignore FILE
# ============================================
# This file tells Docker which files to IGNORE
# (files that don't need to be copied into the container)

# Don't copy node_modules - we'll install fresh dependencies
node_modules

# Don't copy git files - not needed in the container
.git
.gitignore

# Don't copy documentation - not needed to run the app
README.md

# Don't copy environment files - these should be set differently
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Don't copy build outputs - we'll build fresh
dist
build

# Don't copy log files - not needed
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# Don't copy system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Don't copy Docker files themselves
Dockerfile*
.dockerignore*

# ============================================
# WHY DO WE IGNORE THESE FILES?
# ============================================
# - node_modules: We install fresh dependencies in the container
# - .git: Git history isn't needed to run the app
# - dist/build: We build fresh in the container
# - .env files: Environment variables should be passed to container differently
# - Log files: Not needed and can be large
# - System files: OS-specific files that aren't needed
